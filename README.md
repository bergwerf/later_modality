The Logic of Delay
==================
The aim of this project is to formalize propositional logic with the later 
modality. This modality is used by the Iris framework to prove properties
of recursive programs without having to prove their termination.

We prove the completeness of a specific set of axioms, including the axiom of 
comparison, which states the following: For all formulas P and Q,
either P implies Q, or later Q implies P.

Some information about the later modality can be found in this lecture:
